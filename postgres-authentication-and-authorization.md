### Introduction

Security and access control are crucial when developing modern applications. Strong mechanisms are provided to manage user rights and access control by PostgreSQL.

### Creating Roles

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a system used by PostgreSQL to give or remove rights to users and roles. For controlling access to database items, roles are crucial. Let's begin by establishing a few roles:

```sql
-- Create roles
CREATE ROLE admin;
CREATE ROLE author;
CREATE ROLE reader;
```

Roles can have various attributes like `LOGIN`, `SUPERUSER`, and more, depending on requirements.

### Creating Users and Assigning Roles

Now, let's create some users and assign roles to them:

```sql
-- Create users and assign roles
CREATE USER admin_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin_password';
ALTER USER admin_user WITH SUPERUSER;
GRANT admin TO admin_user;

CREATE USER author_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'author_password';
GRANT author TO author_user;

CREATE USER reader_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'reader_password';
GRANT reader TO reader_user;
```

With the help of this code, users are created and given responsibilities like `admin`, `author`, and `reader`.  The `GRANT` command links users to their roles.

### Enforcing Authorization Policies

Let's implement permission policies now that roles and users are established. Describe the capabilities of each role:

```sql
-- Create authorization policies. For example, grant SELECT privilege on a table to readers
GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO reader;
```

You can use `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements to control permissions at various levels, from databases to specific objects.

### Enabling Access Control Lists

Access Control Lists (ACLs) increase security by defining permissions at a more detailed level. For instance, to provide a role on a table particular privileges:

```sql
-- Grant specific privileges using ACLs. For example, grant SELECT and INSERT to author role on a table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON TABLE table_name TO author;
```

ACLs enable you to define precise permissions for roles.

### Implementing Row Level Security

Row Level Security (RLS) allows you to restrict access to specific rows within a database, going beyond the scope of standard ACLs. How to use RLS is described below:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on a table
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Now, we can define RLS policies:

```sql
-- Create an RLS policy to allow access to rows based on a condition
CREATE POLICY rls_policy_name
  ON table_name
  USING (condition);
```

RLS policies provide for precise control of data access based on predetermined circumstances.

### Conclusion

Securing your database in PostgreSQL requires setting up roles, allocating users, enforcing authorization rules, enabling ACLs, and implementing RLS. You can guarantee that users and roles have the proper level of access to your data by carefully controlling permissions and utilizing cutting-edge technologies like ACLs and RLS, improving both security and data integrity.
